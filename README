## goal

1. The goal of this research is to develop a transfer learning-based configuration tuning system that standardizes the representation of database knobs across different DBMSs. 
2. This system will enable the application of models trained on one DBMS to be effectively utilized for tuning another DBMS, despite differences in knob naming conventions and configurations. 
3. By standardizing knob representations, this research aims to significantly reduce the inefficiency and overhead associated with re-training models for each individual DBMS, thereby enhancing the adaptability and scalability of automated database tuning solutions.
